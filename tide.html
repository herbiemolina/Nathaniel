        The Tide that Brought Me Here 
    </h1>

<p>
I kick up dust <br>
I knife the wind<br>
I curse the tide that brought me here…<br>
I strangle legions<br>
Slay the night<br>
And execute the sun with fear<br>
</p>
<p>
They left me here among black rocks, red dirt, and venomous spurs<br>
Amongst the jagged empty sky starving on his words<br>
Songless are the birds which sail above my head<br>
Thorn beaked their vision sleek, the final words he said<br>
“I’ll be circling over you when all is said and done<br>
The sickle knocks upon your door back home you’ll find no one<br>
In the kitchen the stove is hot with blood and toil<br>
In the den the roaches swarm upon the wretched spoils” <br> 
</p>
<p>
He shows his face; floating black against the sun<br>
  Now I wonder t ‘was the true cost of Durham’s Run?<br>
He had us mount the horses, steal the fastest steads<br>
Gave us a taste of riches to tease our tongues’ with greed<br>
And locked us with our weapons for hours everyday<br>
So we could know them like our mothers or the gods to which we prey<br>
He made examples of the lowly, buried lower now<br>
But not before being tied to a dead man’s sow<br>
left in the wild with a smile he’d let nature decide<br>
Not whether you went to heaven, but if you lived or if you died<br>

Durham was the rattlesnake whose tail was forged of gold<br>
With Three diamonds on the inside for each Great Heist of Old<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 now he’s a simple serpent slowly sliding across the ground      <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
When you hear the diamonds shiver you’ll lose all you have found<br>
Earned or gained, he’d laugh like neon acid in the night<br>
For he leaves his victims as empty as the desert without light<br>
He sucks every oasis dry slithering through the veins of mortal men<br>
 Smoking fangs impale hopeful dreams, on itching mirage he lends<br>
Although he appears a broken cowboy old and raw as canyon land<br>
His eyes glow like wild fires riding a dark horse untamed by man<br>
</p>



<p>
You’d think I’d met him in a house that trumps the hand of youth <br>
One which calls from a southern instinct to each unsightly booth<br>
Where corsets like a deck of cards sly the sweat and lust<br>
And everyman becomes an oracle of defiance and mistrust<br>
Tricky fingers on whiskey triggers until tremens settles in<br>
 Delirium a potent remedy to a life that’s short as a shot of gin<br>
</p>
<p>
You’d think I’d find him wrapped around some sobering stool<br>
‘Cause when a straight shooter can’t stand up he sits to keep his cool<br>
Knowing this clenched fist unloaded misfits at the bar<br>
Plotting on the assailant to sweep up the next train car<br>
You’d think I’d find him ‘round an old table sipping mud<br>
Letting his whiskers call the bluff of the dead man dealing stud<br>
</p>
<p>
See Durham wasn’t always a reptile basking in the sun<br>
He knew where to find the unlikely folk to ensure a job was done<br>
He knew a man who keeps to his work values every piece of silver<br>
And he knew a man with a family to lose would give up every sliver<br>
It wasn’t in dim lit tapestries of drunken delights he lurked <br>
I met old Durham in the cemetery on a Sunday after church <br>
</p>
<p>
He had already begun to kindly chat up my newfound wife<br>
then we went for a walk discussing how a man forges out his life<br>
He hid behind the Words of God my mind rapped like an awkward sloth<br>
He said we were all disciples I thought him to be a man of the cloth<br>
But his narrow head turned and slithered like the Rio Grande<br>
And it was an escort that he had me track and put in harm’s way<br>
At first he made no violent motion of his salient plan<br>
For I was just the man tied down accustomed soil of the land<br>
</p>
<p>
He began to throw around his weight in fortunes jaded gold<br>
When he promised me a life of riches my hands began to fold<br>
I thanked the heavens over me for its glorious rays of light<br>
And thought myself a shepherd following the brightest star that night<br>
And though a birth, chance did partake to obscurely lend <br>
I’d rest better in the clawed comfort of Satan’s poignant hands<br>
</p>
<p>
Though Durham was a twisted disaster The Devils never knew<br>
 I was merely a servant, a patsy, and a mule<br>
 a serpent who led me to dark water and swept me up like whirlwind<br> 
 Instead of warm green pastures he crowned me in thorns of sin <br>
It was imbalanced thought which spun my mind like a coffer’s coin<br>
Trapped enwrapped in visions past I never could rejoin<br>
The life of sweat and toil with my heart entrapped by vice<br>
I knew she’d find another and in turn I found my price<br>

</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>

That day the sun was burning like a yolk on far plateau<br>
 I a peasant yearning for thy soft, weighty, sound of gold<br>
When the fiery ball did hang like a bleeding beacon overhead<br>
I prepared myself lock, stock, and barrel, holding my last breath<br>
I was there ill prepared mind swinging like a corpse in the wind<br>
  A simple farmlands carpenter without saw or nail to mend<br>
The course of course the horse did force my arse upon the land<br>
As the coach approached with more jeweled hosts then upon the King’s pale hand<br>
</p>
<p>
Before I detail the derailment of his majesty’s finest carriage<br>
Let me indulge you in the delicacies entwined in luxury’s marriage <br>
Spools of silk like caviar were thread around the opulent coach<br>
 the chasse reinforced with steel to carry tons of bars in gold<br>
Let us not forget the gems from every corner of the earth<br>
T’was said that frankincense and myrrh from the fateful birth<br>
Were placed like priceless relics in a chest dressed in chain and lock<br>
Along with the roman spearhead that spat blood when no sheep flocked<br>
</p>
<p>
Meander they did into the realm of wicked sport<br>
To watch their savior’s body writhe and contort<br>
As I did upon the ground where my horse had laid me down<br>
In the diabolic dust where I felt hooved thunder pound<br>
Blessed by danger all around, I kept my eyes upon the crown<br>
And grabbed my rifle as I stifled to aim the first one down<br>
I could hear the costly carriage like Hephaestus’ hammer sounding<br>
My jaw shaking, rocks raking, the earth quaking all around me <br>
</p>
<p>
It betook my conscience in a game quite like mournful tides<br>
Curious the furious nature of how mind waves coincide<br>
And reverent sides of moral pride spill aqua-red ravine<br>
Face off a broadside battle as the captain’s sword doth gleam<br> 
A hundred cannons pointed solemnly in my direction<br>
Fifty face blood money and fifty face the insurrection<br>
And as these thoughts do bidding upon my future life<br>
I miss the steady swinging hammer and the comfort of my wife<br>
</p>
<p>
Her gaze was more than bread, morning, noon, and night<br>
She nourished my two boys, whose eyes chase after the sunlight<br> 
She taught me more of love then one man could ever know<br>
Together there’s no measure to what knotted seeds can sow<br>
And though I was grasping joyous daydreams of the past<br>
I couldn’t help it; as I did, a gravestone seemed to flash<br>
Like some lowly foreshadowing suspended on a hook <br>
 Sick sense turned me to a pillar like Lot’s wife’s backward look<br>
</p>







<p>
Round the bend of no return the carriage’s chasse roared<br>
I focused all my efforts on pin point sight as I was sure<br>
There’d only be one shot before the menace of their eyes<br>
Would scan the empty horizon for that Morgan Horse of mine<br>
They came like 12 disciples riding gliding through the light<br>
Stirring up the golden dust galloping in stride<br>
The leading man signaled halt as if he’d caught my stench<br>
Cowering like dry flowers in the shade beneath the fence<br>
</p>
<p>
I lined the first one up at the dead end of my sight<br>
 The trigger sweating dusty air through which the bullet flies<br>
Unprecedented it exited my barrel obliterating flash <br>
That makes stones of naïve boys and men of courage dash<br>
 It was a shock for not a rock or man was verily struck<br>
But the horse he road reeled back, and unloaded any beginners luck<br>
I may have had as things turned bad lead men dismounted fast<br>
I found myself a hold up as I counted off the blasts<br>
They got me back a relapse like a stinging whip it stuck<br>
A pain so deep and ghastly my own horse was quickly struck<br>
She took a knee and looked at me as if to say goodbye<br>
I held my ground and made no sound in vain I watched her die<br>
</p>
<p>
I peered on and fired back without delay or remorse<br>
It’s one thing to shoot at a man; it’s another to shoot at his horse<br>
For when I’d first taken aim without blame I tried to hit<br>
The man atop these warless creatures where we madly sit<br>
And at this I thought to lie flat against crumbling ground<br>
And like a glint of sunlight my rifle peeked around<br>
The boulder that gift of cover in thirsty solemn hills<br>
For if I moved for water I could sense the final chills<br>
Cast over me like mystic shadows that parallel a broken sky<br>
Like the heart sunken sorrow when you know you’re ‘bout to die<br>
</p>
<p>
I sighed as the reply of my six shooter clicked<br>
 sat down upon a cactus without the smallest prick<br>
A bullet sailed o’er my head taking with it just my hat<br>
 The barrage blinded me in deadlight singing Satan’s wrath<br>
It moaned and screamed a piercing howl closing in<br>
Then I remembered my saddlebag perhaps my salvation<br>
Plenty of ammo it contained to hold scar-faced cherubs back<br>
And one stick, a wicker jaunt, wouldn’t give them time to pack<br>
The attack grew closer to me voices crept like earthly vines<br>
“He’s there! No there! No he’s up near the ole Rhyolite mine!”<br>

</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
In truth I hadn’t noticed the small mine shaft up ahead <br>
Three wood posts spread sacred darkness to escape the flying lead<br>
First I needed the saddlebag which lay soaked by my companion<br>
I ran holding my heart a good ten yards insane Olympic champion<br>
Diving down behind her body I scampered through the sand <br>
And with true grit I felt a fit with the Magnum in my hand<br>
The worst she burst like rocket fire again and again<br>
A fountain of blood across my face enraged me to no end<br>
</p>
<p>
I reared back, licked my lips, with my arms across her hide<br>
I tasted her blood in the wretched mud letting two silver fish fly<br>
There he swam as the telegram was rapidly received<br>
A death notice for this man at once, now twice bereaved<br>
They ignored their fallen comrade not rushing to his aid in panic<br>
Instead they rabidly charged the hills with gunfire more sporadic<br>
</p>
<p>
Climactic frantic tragic I gazed at the Lord Zenith sun<br>
Unknowing the anger glowing at the true cost of Durham’s Run<br>
Was heavy on my back like the barren olive cross<br>
 A stranger in the world only to have a sense of loss<br>
Once I had the ammo and that stick of Dynamite<br>
I saw below another party had spritely taken flight<br>
Up the hills in my direction observing a shining star<br>
Upon the breast of the cavalry approaching not too far<br>
As I felt a ghost behind me kindly unveil with words of whisper<br>
And they crept upon my spine making every hair end shiver<br>
</p>
<p>
I knew that frightful sense from unsightly residence <br>
Who inhabited this land without grateful evidence<br>
That he knew me prior with desire to this lurid occasion<br>
I recognized Old Durham above his soulless eye was an abrasion<br>
And with him a posse dressed neatly in the outfit of the law<br>
 to aid his majesty’s carriage in this untimely brawl<br>
scrawled upon the wall a prisoner counting down the days<br>
I felt them closing in trapped in my mind’s sordid maze<br>
</p>
<p>
Durham called out “Thief stop right where you are!<br>
because if you move your life you’ll lose having not gone far”<br>
I ignored his words beyond absurd and couldn’t read his game<br>
I meant him in the cemetery where he pointed out his name<br>
Upon a stone as if to say his crest was buried there<br>
Yet when he approached the Holy Ghost would vanish in thin air<br>
I didn’t care to contemplate and stare into a mad man’s eyes<br>
In a pool of blood I saw enough of these lost reflective cries <br>

</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
Both hands shaking, bullets flying, I withdrew a lonely match<br>
Ricocheting, allocating, one stick for the entire batch<br>
Of soldiers, outlaws, lawmen I didn’t seem to care<br>
with 30 seconds per foot of fuse before I tossed it in the air<br>
30 seconds to think about ungodly woes on earth<br>
And 30 seconds before I unleashed hell unlike Pandora’s worst<br>
Curse in tones of maunder wander begging about my mind<br>
For some sense of reason like the dusty trail I’d left behind<br> 
Yet nowhere through the air could bullets sense my sanity<br>
For I had lost the glorious prize upon birth handed to me<br>
</p>
<p>
So with a blessing upon my chest outlining the savior’s cross<br>
I gave the dynamite a sickened heave skyward faithful toss<br>
And ran unplanned into the darkness of that sad black cavern<br>
Where men of old would mine their gold to lose it in the tavern<br>
I squeezed my fragile flesh through the nails and rotting wood<br>
Then waited for the statement that might send them back for good<br>
</p>
<p>
It came and rang an awful pang as the canyon gorge imploded<br>
And I heard the cries of mortal men as their hearts exploded<br>
Telltale sign aftermath’s design of purple silence and distrust<br>
Then I heard his voice whisper in the settling sovereign dust<br>
The entrance from which I came was now eerily pitch black<br>
Yearning for return no concern to question going back<br>
And with that wick and wicked trick my bridges I had burned<br>
Without canary, candle, or compass these questions only turned<br>
 in every direction as I accepted requested eternal blindness<br>
I was no longer a Good Samaritan lacking a single crumb of kindness<br>
</p>
<p>
But that’s behind us as I felt the psyche split in two<br>
And we curiously debated what in God’s name should we do<br>
Without a crew I knew I must disband cautious steps<br>
I sunk down without a sound knowing I must accept<br>
The exceptions of these final hours, which seem to pass as days<br>
And the seconds like sixteenth notes and my hopes still further frayed<br>
Until I prayed to St. Dymphna thinking I had heard a laugh<br>
So I shouted “Curse you god!” and I heard an echo back<br>
</p>
<p>
Cackling in the rafters of that old trembling mine shaft<br>
I proposed a desperate question and received my answer back<br>
“If you are so almighty then why don’t you save your precious flock<br>
from this miserable life that’s just a door upon which Satan knocks?”<br>
And then the greatest roar of laughter that I have ever heard<br>
Burst forth in doubt religious drought succinct with spoken words<br>
“My dear child it’s been a while surely now you see<br>
There never was a carpenter who hailed from Galilee.”<br>
I searched around nothing I found I truthfully believe<br>
“You see my child since the dawn of time there has been only me!”<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
And I fell upon my back full of dread and certain fear<br>
Out of the darkness disembarked this frightful diseased sneer<br>
It lingered as my trigger held guarding my life fading last<br>
Breath I aimed and pulled illuminating the dark mine shaft<br>
The target I couldn’t see though I thought I had aimed high<br>
Then I saw a fateful glimmer and a scar above the eye<br>
I leapt back again, inside my cozy coffin I desired to be<br>
For it was him ruler of sin who glared right back at me<br>
</p>
<p>
“take my hand he said and we shall both be out of here”<br>
I looked around, up and down with darkness never(Oh!) so near<br>
I reached out and cried aloud when I felt my senses slip<br>
And like a nail halfway impaled he kept tight his sharp clawed grip<br>
In a flash of amnesia I floated slowly toward a blinding light<br>
And cast away my legs and arms as if I was born to fly<br>
</p>
<p>
I arrived alive outside of that collapsing mine<br>
And what caught my eye against the sky a single star did shine<br>
I felt belief bequeath beneath the horror in my chest<br>
 Then realized it was the sheriff’s star clipped to ole Durham’s vest<br>
 “I got him!” he said reassuring the escort of what was real<br>
 I felt around my wrist the rapture of cold comfortable steel<br>
And as submission settled in and he tied me to his horse<br>
I saw body parts and bloody dressing of which I was the source<br>
They were scattered like afterthoughts upon their very graves<br>
And I felt a lethal force inside me no one there could save<br>
</p>
<p>
Durham reassured them that they would arrive at their destined town<br>
And that no matter what upon his life he swore to protect the crown<br>
My head cast down I stumbled through the desert’s fragrant dust<br>
And thought of all the missing men I had entombed at once<br>
Bedraggled and belittled torn behind this new escort<br>
 His fanciful exploits but a ploy to seize what they import<br>
</p>
<p>
We hiked forever hours my legs cowered at the task<br>
They teased and tossed the canteen dipping water from the cask<br>
As darkness descended my lips withered, broke, and blistered<br>
And I fell upon the ground a dying sound the reaper whispered<br>
“Not too long to go before we slow to a poor man’s pace<br>
Not too long to go before you meet your maker face to face”<br>
I inhaled dust from the ground and began to disassociate<br>
Any fortune only ruin had consumed my human fate<br>

</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
“Let him rest,” cried one of the men who escorted his majesty’s riches<br>
“And let him not suffer like the vagrant, starving, murderer he is?”<br>
Spoke Ole Durham in his finest approachable human voice<br>
“He’s a murdering thief and now his life has but one choice”<br>
“Don’t be callow he’ll reach swinging gallows soon enough”<br>
 at that Durham stopped his horse; I barely managed to stand up<br>
</p>
<p>
One of the men spared me some kind, clean water, out of pity<br>
Then I noticed it had been hours without the silhouette of a city<br>
In the distance roared the wind, which swept over rolling dunes<br>
And I heard that cackle from the mine a dark carnival tune<br>
I looked about Durham and his horse no longer near<br>
The other men now wondered if he’d all but disappeared<br>
</p>
<p>
And one man dropped like a condemned rider from his horse<br>
 Then like flies they said goodbye no longer blood did course<br>
Through their veins as bullets rained upon the departing party<br>
Starting for the desert some attempted to escape into the starry<br>
Night as they took flight, but stinging bite caught them in the back<br>
And they fell upon red sand stopped like stones in their last track<br>
</p>
<p>
There was a man inside the carriage who I hadn’t seen before<br>
And he broke out with a weapon I’d thought was just folk lore<br>
The gun it spun and spewed more sparks and tracers from the wagon<br>
Then he flipped a switch and in a stitch it blew fire like a dragon<br>
He didn’t aim for the distance, but instead sharply began <br>
To fire at what he thought to be the Sheriff’s loyal men<br>
It finally occurred to him Ole Durham’s sacred ruse<br>
I was just the crossfire tripwire for the fuse<br>
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to take me dead boys and my ghost will still haunt thee!”<br>
In one poignant burst of flame the mad man skewered roughly three<br>
Others as sulfur and burning flesh awoken my keen nostrils<br>
I saw despite attempts his men died one by one like the apostles<br>
Hostile as it was a king’s soldier unshackled me<br>
He handed me a weapon, which I told him I didn’t need<br>
“Now murderer, do your best to slay that sheriff down<br>
I just laughed and said “he doesn’t even walk on solid ground.”<br>
</p>
<p>
He turned around laid down by a gunshot to his head<br>
I saw his eyes roll back with a quickness he wound up dead<br>
The last man standing I suppose we shall call him Mad John<br>
Began to load large shells and rain hell upon the crack of dawn<br>
The ground burst open blown apart from his Armageddon Gun<br>
I saw an empty horse ride towards the cobalt sky against the sun<br>
Rise to avoid demise I crouched behind the hard steel chasse<br>
And I heard John call again “Son of a bitch! Here I am come and get me!”<br>
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>
I wish he hadn’t made such remarks to inspire Durham’s Wrath<br>
And from the dunes my thoughts consumed again I heard him laugh<br>
It was the loudest snicker rising quickly from the depths<br>
I peered through the covered wagon thinking death we must accept<br>
Then a sight I’d thought I’d  never see fell upon Mad John<br>
And a burst of flames ripped the body’s frame until he was gone<br>
</p>
<p>
All that was left of John was a ring of rusted keys<br>
I jumped into the carriage and tried to find what I could free<br>
I unlocked a box and wrapped in cloth was an ancient Roman spear<br>
I grabbed it cautiously waiting sure that Durham would come near<br>
In a startling flash he appeared quite clear directly next to me<br>
 I thrust the spear into his ribs and he looked down ashamed to see<br>
Black blood that turned to cock roaches pouring from his wound<br>
They crawled across the carriage floor and up over my boots<br>
Then he laid a clawed finger upon his bursting hemorrhage<br>
Removed the spear and leaning back attempting to gain leverage<br>
Kicked him in the chest with what little strength I could muster<br>
It had no affect I was trapped by death like the foolish Custer<br>
</p>
<p>
He smiled like a crocodile into my startled eyes he peered<br>
I see you found the precise point of the Old Clan’s spear<br>
With some cheer he took the blade the wound sealed sans a scratch<br>
And so I wondered who had laid the scar above his eye attached<br>
To my shaking soul I grew cold and hurried back<br>
Away from the carriage and the remains no longer intact<br> 
As I turned his mind had learned where I’d thought to Run<br>
Like Ole Durham I’d rather burn in hell then under this scorching sun<br>
</p>
<p>
I took that faithful Magnum one bullet in it spun<br>
And I hoped my best I’d lay down to rest in my savior’s arms<br>
my finger quivered on the trigger shot delivered to appoint just one<br>
Yet two arms held me tight without delight askew it grazed the sun<br>
 I looked back the breath upon my back smelled like a day old corpse<br>
And noticed the shadow o’er me had wings like Hercules’s horse<br>
Ole Durham hogtied me up throwing me nameless with the luggage<br>
I mumbled through the rope tied round my teeth choking courage<br>
</p>
<p>
“So Macintyre we’re heading back to where this all began<br>
Back to your workshop and the homestead where this all will end<br>
I growled and I howled through the suffocating rope<br>
For I knew he had it in him to exploit humanity’s last hope<br>
Don’t get me wrong unlike the throngs I expected not to live<br>
 the awkward speech was out of reach resilient eyes all I could give<br>
a gaze of hate I learned of late pestiferous infested<br>
A fawn a pawn the perfect dawn cleverly arrested<br>



</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>

At great length with inhuman strength Durham pulled the precious loot<br>
For the horses that once carried the coach now grew amongst the roots<br>
So once more my heart assured of nothing but disaster<br>
We marched until we reached a fence as white as alabaster<br>
It marked the beginning of the end of the only hearth and home<br>
Where my mother was born and died, the only one I’d ever known<br>
</p>
<p>
Then my sight wrapped tightly as my vision was extinguished<br>
But the voices of my son and wife I thankfully distinguished<br>
“In the Devil’s English” he said “call them closer still” <br>
I screamed at them to run away, but they couldn’t hear my will<br>
My warning cries soon subsided as a striking blow<br>
Ripped my chest in an attempt to lay me down below<br>
And as I struggled to untie the muzzle pinned up in prison coach<br>
I heard Ole Durham say “Sorry Mam he didn’t make it home<br>
It’s my regret to inform you that poor Macintyre’s gone<br>
He lost his life in a noble fight before the fire-crack of dawn.”<br> 
</p>
<p>
“What…do you mean?” My wife at once stuttered shattered tears<br>
And I wished with all my might to fight my way right out of here<br>
“Let’s go to the house and I’ll tell you how outlaws ambushed our trail<br>
Just put a pot upon the stove I’ll list every tragic detail.”<br>
From far away I could not relay the misery of my thoughts<br>
As I heard the ominous ringing of two murderous shots<br>
</p>
<p>
Then a thump in turn bodies still warm Durham laid next to me<br>
The smell of lavender the touch of lace opposing ecstasy<br>
I’d never thought I’d have to live as the soft touch of a her hair<br>
Reminded me that my own greed had stripped my world bare<br>
Again we rode the dust it flowed suffocating my aching heart<br>
The coach rattled while I prattled feeling my lungs could tear apart<br>
Snaking through the desert I surrendered measurements of time<br>
I took a breath as to my left I thought of Auld Lang Syne<br>
</p>
<p>
I missed the smell of sawdust and the discoloring of rust<br>
I missed the love we made and her open arms of trust<br>
For it was I who did comply with Durham’s ingenious plan<br>
 I came back shackled an animal tamed by the genius of man<br>
But man, flesh, and cherub are many different things<br>
Or one in the same traveling through horrific cosmic rings<br>
</p>
<p>
So as I was tossed around these thoughts conflicting in my head<br>
On my way somewhere unknown unto my final resting bed<br>
Durham was humming and singing that he had found two solid horses<br>
So as he whipped his song rang out with all the vigor of hell’s forces<br>
 it conspired within me a demon’s choir dancing through the night<br>
Lost amidst chaotic reverie confined to emphatic tragic plight<br>
</p>
<p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>


So with one last stare I focused a prayer to save my vagrant soul<br>
 perhaps I might see the Great Light and rest with my family cold<br>
I reached in vain for the savior’s name albeit fate made me guilty<br>
It was my wicked will that caused it still convinced me innocently<br>
When your hands are tied and your eyes are blind what else can one do?<br>
But hope that fate will open the gate forgiving honest men of evil’s ruse<br>
Finally I felt no answer as my sweetheart rolled against me<br>
 I was reminded how ole Durham chided The Kingdom was always empty<br>
</p>
<p>
    <br>
Like Old Goodman Brown I rolled around amongst the anxious horror<br>
I started out a fine poor man while inside I grew much poorer<br>
Here we are as the loaded car came to a violent halt<br>
My stomach turned and twitched awaiting one final result<br>
He dragged me out without a bout threw me amongst the dusty ground<br>
“Macintyre I picked you out a lovely spot where the view is quite profound”<br>
He began to tie two laden objects to each of my calm hands<br>
Then roped my feet and assured me that I’d love the lay of the land<br>
</p>
<p>
And as a joke he laughed and smoked putting two coins in my hand<br>
“You’ll need to pay the fare and hell; I’d like to see you once again”<br>
He untied the fold around my eyes and I could no longer doubt<br>
The objects that were tied to me, which made me scream and shout<br>
Appalled as if I had not fallen downward far enough<br>
My good wife Lucille and my son Tim lay with me on the bluff<br>
I cried and gasped split visions past and cursed only myself<br>
For the devil himself knew he was there tied down upon that shelf<br>
</p>
<p>
Then Durham uttered those foretold words I shuttered at the thought<br>
He muttered something quietly as his cracked lips wrought<br>
“I’ll be circling over you when all is said and done<br>
The reaper knocks upon your door back home you’ll find no one<br>
In the kitchen the stove is hot with blood and toil<br>
And in the den the roaches swarm upon the wretched spoils.”<br>
</p>
<p>
I lay there baring a day and wished only to find my Magnum<br>
Or celebrate my circumstance with a friendly dose of Laudanum<br>
I dared not see my family there as vultures settled in<br>
  Remnants evidence of the elements naturally fermenting<br>
When night came I feigned not to look at the dark beauty of the sky<br>
For the illumination of all constellations peered like Durham’s soulless eyes<br>
</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
When the morning flamed the barbed tongues came a picking bone<br>
And in the dawn without a yawn I prayed today they’d take me home<br>
I tried not to watch and sometimes rolled shooing the bastard flock away<br>
 Whether it was in the air or on the ground the black winged creatures stayed<br>
Suddenly unexpectedly the ground sounded of strange vibration<br>
And soon a tune of hooves was heard I wished no jubilation<br>
I only desired to be with the fallen, knowing my last son<br>
Had most likely met the same fate and life’s love was surely gone<br>
</p>
<p>
But upon the horizon now enlivened I heard a familiar cry<br>
And the voice brought only tears to my scorched and mournful eyes<br>
“Pa?” he said and then he stopped and laid ambition down<br>
For he saw the sight of me next to what is buried in the ground<br>
“No Pa! No Ma!” I heard his quivering eyes start flowing <br>
 he gasped collapsed taken aback by what is not worth knowing<br>
</p>
<p>
“Will” I said as he could not began to manage the thought<br>
And he threw his hands about the mess waving the pestilence off<br> 
Coughing gagging I saw him heaving suddenly turning sick<br>
Then he composed himself and freed me from Durham’s nasty trick<br>
I had no strength to embrace my oldest son who clenched my coat<br>
Then took me in his arms and wrapped me where I soaked<br>
So the loss of life was saved as I began to ask<br>
 he said he’d come from home then followed wheel tracks<br>
To this spot where I was to rot with the sad deceased<br>
And too this day I’m still unsure if I ever was released <br>
</p>
<p>
For when I got home with time alone it came framing memory lapse<br>
And outside the night I swore I might have heard Ole Durham laugh<br>
But I didn’t follow my current sorrow like a treasure map<br>
  then Will came in and said “I’ll break that poor Ole Bastard’s back”<br>
I told him he must wait for when the time was right<br>
 That it might never come, a poet’s vision in the night<br>
So goes the joyful woes of man’s luring price foretold<br>
So goes the chilling tale of Three Great Heists of Old<br>
