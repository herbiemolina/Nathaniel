    <h1>
        The Tide that Brought Me Here
    </h1>

    <p> 

        I kick up dust 
        I knife the wind
        I curse the tide that brought me here…
        I strangle legions
        Slay the night
        And execute the sun with fear
        
        They left me here among black rocks, red dirt, and venomous spurs
        Amongst the jagged empty sky starving on his words
        Songless are the birds which sail above my head
        Thorn beaked their vision sleek, the final words he said
        “I’ll be circling over you when all is said and done
        The sickle knocks upon your door back home you’ll find no one
        In the kitchen the stove is hot with blood and toil
        In the den the roaches swarm upon the wretched spoils”  
        
        
        He shows his face; floating black against the sun
          Now I wonder t ‘was the true cost of Durham’s Run?
        He had us mount the horses, steal the fastest steads
        Gave us a taste of riches to tease our tongues’ with greed
        And locked us with our weapons for hours everyday
        So we could know them like our mothers or the gods to which we prey
        He made examples of the lowly, buried lower now
        But not before being tied to a dead man’s sow
        left in the wild with a smile he’d let nature decide
        Not whether you went to heaven, but if you lived or if you died

       
        Durham was the rattlesnake whose tail was forged of gold
        With Three diamonds on the inside for each Great Heist of Old                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
         now he’s a simple serpent slowly sliding across the ground                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
        When you hear the diamonds shiver you’ll lose all you have found
        Earned or gained, he’d laugh like neon acid in the night
        For he leaves his victims as empty as the desert without light
        He sucks every oasis dry slithering through the veins of mortal men
         Smoking fangs impale hopeful dreams, on itching mirage he lends
        Although he appears a broken cowboy old and raw as canyon land
        His eyes glow like wild fires riding a dark horse untamed by man
        
        
        
        
        
        You’d think I’d met him in a house that trumps the hand of youth 
        One which calls from a southern instinct to each unsightly booth
        Where corsets like a deck of cards sly the sweat and lust
        And everyman becomes an oracle of defiance and mistrust
        Tricky fingers on whiskey triggers until tremens settles in
         Delirium a potent remedy to a life that’s short as a shot of gin
        
        You’d think I’d find him wrapped around some sobering stool
        ‘Cause when a straight shooter can’t stand up he sits to keep his cool
        Knowing this clenched fist unloaded misfits at the bar
        Plotting on the assailant to sweep up the next train car
        You’d think I’d find him ‘round an old table sipping mud
        Letting his whiskers call the bluff of the dead man dealing stud
        
        See Durham wasn’t always a reptile basking in the sun
        He knew where to find the unlikely folk to ensure a job was done
        He knew a man who keeps to his work values every piece of silver
        And he knew a man with a family to lose would give up every sliver
        It wasn’t in dim lit tapestries of drunken delights he lurked 
        I met old Durham in the cemetery on a Sunday after church 
        
        He had already begun to kindly chat up my newfound wife
        then we went for a walk discussing how a man forges out his life
        He hid behind the Words of God my mind rapped like an awkward sloth
        He said we were all disciples I thought him to be a man of the cloth
        But his narrow head turned and slithered like the Rio Grande
        And it was an escort that he had me track and put in harm’s way
        At first he made no violent motion of his salient plan
        For I was just the man tied down accustomed soil of the land
        
        He began to throw around his weight in fortunes jaded gold
        When he promised me a life of riches my hands began to fold
        I thanked the heavens over me for its glorious rays of light
        And thought myself a shepherd following the brightest star that night
        And though a birth, chance did partake to obscurely lend 
        I’d rest better in the clawed comfort of Satan’s poignant hands
        
        Though Durham was a twisted disaster The Devils never knew
         I was merely a servant, a patsy, and a mule
         a serpent who led me to dark water and swept me up like whirlwind 
         Instead of warm green pastures he crowned me in thorns of sin 
        It was imbalanced thought which spun my mind like a coffer’s coin
        Trapped enwrapped in visions past I never could rejoin
        The life of sweat and toil with my heart entrapped by vice
        I knew she’d find another and in turn I found my price
        
        
        
        
        
        
        That day the sun was burning like a yolk on far plateau
         I a peasant yearning for thy soft, weighty, sound of gold
        When the fiery ball did hang like a bleeding beacon overhead
        I prepared myself lock, stock, and barrel, holding my last breath
        I was there ill prepared mind swinging like a corpse in the wind
          A simple farmlands carpenter without saw or nail to mend
        The course of course the horse did force my arse upon the land
        As the coach approached with more jeweled hosts then upon the King’s pale hand
        
        Before I detail the derailment of his majesty’s finest carriage
        Let me indulge you in the delicacies entwined in luxury’s marriage 
        Spools of silk like caviar were thread around the opulent coach
         the chasse reinforced with steel to carry tons of bars in gold
        Let us not forget the gems from every corner of the earth
        T’was said that frankincense and myrrh from the fateful birth
        Were placed like priceless relics in a chest dressed in chain and lock
        Along with the roman spearhead that spat blood when no sheep flocked
        
        Meander they did into the realm of wicked sport
        To watch their savior’s body writhe and contort
        As I did upon the ground where my horse had laid me down
        In the diabolic dust where I felt hooved thunder pound
        Blessed by danger all around, I kept my eyes upon the crown
        And grabbed my rifle as I stifled to aim the first one down
        I could hear the costly carriage like Hephaestus’ hammer sounding
        My jaw shaking, rocks raking, the earth quaking all around me 
        
        It betook my conscience in a game quite like mournful tides
        Curious the furious nature of how mind waves coincide
        And reverent sides of moral pride spill aqua-red ravine
        Face off a broadside battle as the captain’s sword doth gleam 
        A hundred cannons pointed solemnly in my direction
        Fifty face blood money and fifty face the insurrection
        And as these thoughts do bidding upon my future life
        I miss the steady swinging hammer and the comfort of my wife
        
        Her gaze was more than bread, morning, noon, and night
        She nourished my two boys, whose eyes chase after the sunlight 
        She taught me more of love then one man could ever know
        Together there’s no measure to what knotted seeds can sow
        And though I was grasping joyous daydreams of the past
        I couldn’t help it; as I did, a gravestone seemed to flash
        Like some lowly foreshadowing suspended on a hook 
         Sick sense turned me to a pillar like Lot’s wife’s backward look
        
        
        
        
        
        
         
        Round the bend of no return the carriage’s chasse roared
        I focused all my efforts on pin point sight as I was sure
        There’d only be one shot before the menace of their eyes
        Would scan the empty horizon for that Morgan Horse of mine
        They came like 12 disciples riding gliding through the light
        Stirring up the golden dust galloping in stride
        The leading man signaled halt as if he’d caught my stench
        Cowering like dry flowers in the shade beneath the fence
        
        I lined the first one up at the dead end of my sight
         The trigger sweating dusty air through which the bullet flies
        Unprecedented it exited my barrel obliterating flash 
        That makes stones of naïve boys and men of courage dash
         It was a shock for not a rock or man was verily struck
        But the horse he road reeled back, and unloaded any beginners luck
        I may have had as things turned bad lead men dismounted fast
        I found myself a hold up as I counted off the blasts
        They got me back a relapse like a stinging whip it stuck
        A pain so deep and ghastly my own horse was quickly struck
        She took a knee and looked at me as if to say goodbye
        I held my ground and made no sound in vain I watched her die
        
        I peered on and fired back without delay or remorse
        It’s one thing to shoot at a man; it’s another to shoot at his horse
        For when I’d first taken aim without blame I tried to hit
        The man atop these warless creatures where we madly sit
        And at this I thought to lie flat against crumbling ground
        And like a glint of sunlight my rifle peeked around
        The boulder that gift of cover in thirsty solemn hills
        For if I moved for water I could sense the final chills
        Cast over me like mystic shadows that parallel a broken sky
        Like the heart sunken sorrow when you know you’re ‘bout to die
        
        I sighed as the reply of my six shooter clicked
         sat down upon a cactus without the smallest prick
        A bullet sailed o’er my head taking with it just my hat
         The barrage blinded me in deadlight singing Satan’s wrath
        It moaned and screamed a piercing howl closing in
        Then I remembered my saddlebag perhaps my salvation
        Plenty of ammo it contained to hold scar-faced cherubs back
        And one stick, a wicker jaunt, wouldn’t give them time to pack
        The attack grew closer to me voices crept like earthly vines
        “He’s there! No there! No he’s up near the ole Rhyolite mine!”
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        In truth I hadn’t noticed the small mine shaft up ahead 
        Three wood posts spread sacred darkness to escape the flying lead
        First I needed the saddlebag which lay soaked by my companion
        I ran holding my heart a good ten yards insane Olympic champion
        Diving down behind her body I scampered through the sand 
        And with true grit I felt a fit with the Magnum in my hand
        The worst she burst like rocket fire again and again
        A fountain of blood across my face enraged me to no end
        
        I reared back, licked my lips, with my arms across her hide
        I tasted her blood in the wretched mud letting two silver fish fly
        There he swam as the telegram was rapidly received
        A death notice for this man at once, now twice bereaved
        They ignored their fallen comrade not rushing to his aid in panic
        Instead they rabidly charged the hills with gunfire more sporadic
         
        Climactic frantic tragic I gazed at the Lord Zenith sun
        Unknowing the anger glowing at the true cost of Durham’s Run
        Was heavy on my back like the barren olive cross
         A stranger in the world only to have a sense of loss
        Once I had the ammo and that stick of Dynamite
        I saw below another party had spritely taken flight
        Up the hills in my direction observing a shining star
        Upon the breast of the cavalry approaching not too far
        As I felt a ghost behind me kindly unveil with words of whisper
        And they crept upon my spine making every hair end shiver
        
        I knew that frightful sense from unsightly residence 
        Who inhabited this land without grateful evidence
        That he knew me prior with desire to this lurid occasion
        I recognized Old Durham above his soulless eye was an abrasion
        And with him a posse dressed neatly in the outfit of the law
         to aid his majesty’s carriage in this untimely brawl
        scrawled upon the wall a prisoner counting down the days
        I felt them closing in trapped in my mind’s sordid maze
        
        Durham called out “Thief stop right where you are!
        because if you move your life you’ll lose having not gone far”
        I ignored his words beyond absurd and couldn’t read his game
        I meant him in the cemetery where he pointed out his name
        Upon a stone as if to say his crest was buried there
        Yet when he approached the Holy Ghost would vanish in thin air
        I didn’t care to contemplate and stare into a mad man’s eyes
        In a pool of blood I saw enough of these lost reflective cries 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Both hands shaking, bullets flying, I withdrew a lonely match
        Ricocheting, allocating, one stick for the entire batch
        Of soldiers, outlaws, lawmen I didn’t seem to care
        with 30 seconds per foot of fuse before I tossed it in the air
        30 seconds to think about ungodly woes on earth
        And 30 seconds before I unleashed hell unlike Pandora’s worst
        Curse in tones of maunder wander begging about my mind
        For some sense of reason like the dusty trail I’d left behind 
        Yet nowhere through the air could bullets sense my sanity
        For I had lost the glorious prize upon birth handed to me
        
        So with a blessing upon my chest outlining the savior’s cross
        I gave the dynamite a sickened heave skyward faithful toss
        And ran unplanned into the darkness of that sad black cavern
        Where men of old would mine their gold to lose it in the tavern
        I squeezed my fragile flesh through the nails and rotting wood
        Then waited for the statement that might send them back for good
        
        It came and rang an awful pang as the canyon gorge imploded
        And I heard the cries of mortal men as their hearts exploded
        Telltale sign aftermath’s design of purple silence and distrust
        Then I heard his voice whisper in the settling sovereign dust
        The entrance from which I came was now eerily pitch black
        Yearning for return no concern to question going back
        And with that wick and wicked trick my bridges I had burned
        Without canary, candle, or compass these questions only turned
         in every direction as I accepted requested eternal blindness
        I was no longer a Good Samaritan lacking a single crumb of kindness
        
        But that’s behind us as I felt the psyche split in two
        And we curiously debated what in God’s name should we do
        Without a crew I knew I must disband cautious steps
        I sunk down without a sound knowing I must accept
        The exceptions of these final hours, which seem to pass as days
        And the seconds like sixteenth notes and my hopes still further frayed
        Until I prayed to St. Dymphna thinking I had heard a laugh
        So I shouted “Curse you god!” and I heard an echo back
        
        Cackling in the rafters of that old trembling mine shaft
        I proposed a desperate question and received my answer back
        “If you are so almighty then why don’t you save your precious flock
        from this miserable life that’s just a door upon which Satan knocks?”
        And then the greatest roar of laughter that I have ever heard
        Burst forth in doubt religious drought succinct with spoken words
        “My dear child it’s been a while surely now you see
        There never was a carpenter who hailed from Galilee.”
        I searched around nothing I found I truthfully believe
        “You see my child since the dawn of time there has been only me!”
        
        
        
        And I fell upon my back full of dread and certain fear
        Out of the darkness disembarked this frightful diseased sneer
        It lingered as my trigger held guarding my life fading last
        Breath I aimed and pulled illuminating the dark mine shaft
        The target I couldn’t see though I thought I had aimed high
        Then I saw a fateful glimmer and a scar above the eye
        I leapt back again, inside my cozy coffin I desired to be
        For it was him ruler of sin who glared right back at me
        
        “take my hand he said and we shall both be out of here”
        I looked around, up and down with darkness never(Oh!) so near
        I reached out and cried aloud when I felt my senses slip
        And like a nail halfway impaled he kept tight his sharp clawed grip
        In a flash of amnesia I floated slowly toward a blinding light
        And cast away my legs and arms as if I was born to fly
        
        I arrived alive outside of that collapsing mine
        And what caught my eye against the sky a single star did shine
        I felt belief bequeath beneath the horror in my chest
         Then realized it was the sheriff’s star clipped to ole Durham’s vest
         “I got him!” he said reassuring the escort of what was real
         I felt around my wrist the rapture of cold comfortable steel
        And as submission settled in and he tied me to his horse
        I saw body parts and bloody dressing of which I was the source
        They were scattered like afterthoughts upon their very graves
        And I felt a lethal force inside me no one there could save
        
        Durham reassured them that they would arrive at their destined town
        And that no matter what upon his life he swore to protect the crown
        My head cast down I stumbled through the desert’s fragrant dust
        And thought of all the missing men I had entombed at once
        Bedraggled and belittled torn behind this new escort
         His fanciful exploits but a ploy to seize what they import
        
        We hiked forever hours my legs cowered at the task
        They teased and tossed the canteen dipping water from the cask
        As darkness descended my lips withered, broke, and blistered
        And I fell upon the ground a dying sound the reaper whispered
        “Not too long to go before we slow to a poor man’s pace
        Not too long to go before you meet your maker face to face”
        I inhaled dust from the ground and began to disassociate
        Any fortune only ruin had consumed my human fate
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        “Let him rest,” cried one of the men who escorted his majesty’s riches
        “And let him not suffer like the vagrant, starving, murderer he is?”
        Spoke Ole Durham in his finest approachable human voice
        “He’s a murdering thief and now his life has but one choice”
        “Don’t be callow he’ll reach swinging gallows soon enough”
         at that Durham stopped his horse; I barely managed to stand up
        
        One of the men spared me some kind, clean water, out of pity
        Then I noticed it had been hours without the silhouette of a city
        In the distance roared the wind, which swept over rolling dunes
        And I heard that cackle from the mine a dark carnival tune
        I looked about Durham and his horse no longer near
        The other men now wondered if he’d all but disappeared
        
        And one man dropped like a condemned rider from his horse
         Then like flies they said goodbye no longer blood did course
        Through their veins as bullets rained upon the departing party
        Starting for the desert some attempted to escape into the starry
        Night as they took flight, but stinging bite caught them in the back
        And they fell upon red sand stopped like stones in their last track
        
        There was a man inside the carriage who I hadn’t seen before
        And he broke out with a weapon I’d thought was just folk lore
        The gun it spun and spewed more sparks and tracers from the wagon
        Then he flipped a switch and in a stitch it blew fire like a dragon
        He didn’t aim for the distance, but instead sharply began 
        To fire at what he thought to be the Sheriff’s loyal men
        It finally occurred to him Ole Durham’s sacred ruse
        I was just the crossfire tripwire for the fuse
        
        “You’ll have to take me dead boys and my ghost will still haunt thee!”
        In one poignant burst of flame the mad man skewered roughly three
        Others as sulfur and burning flesh awoken my keen nostrils
        I saw despite attempts his men died one by one like the apostles
        Hostile as it was a king’s soldier unshackled me
        He handed me a weapon, which I told him I didn’t need
        “Now murderer, do your best to slay that sheriff down
        I just laughed and said “he doesn’t even walk on solid ground.”
        
        He turned around laid down by a gunshot to his head
        I saw his eyes roll back with a quickness he wound up dead
        The last man standing I suppose we shall call him Mad John
        Began to load large shells and rain hell upon the crack of dawn
        The ground burst open blown apart from his Armageddon Gun
        I saw an empty horse ride towards the cobalt sky against the sun
        Rise to avoid demise I crouched behind the hard steel chasse
        And I heard John call again “Son of a bitch! Here I am come and get me!”
        
        
        
        
        I wish he hadn’t made such remarks to inspire Durham’s Wrath
        And from the dunes my thoughts consumed again I heard him laugh
        It was the loudest snicker rising quickly from the depths
        I peered through the covered wagon thinking death we must accept
        Then a sight I’d thought I’d  never see fell upon Mad John
        And a burst of flames ripped the body’s frame until he was gone
        
        All that was left of John was a ring of rusted keys
        I jumped into the carriage and tried to find what I could free
        I unlocked a box and wrapped in cloth was an ancient Roman spear
        I grabbed it cautiously waiting sure that Durham would come near
        In a startling flash he appeared quite clear directly next to me
         I thrust the spear into his ribs and he looked down ashamed to see
        Black blood that turned to cock roaches pouring from his wound
        They crawled across the carriage floor and up over my boots
        Then he laid a clawed finger upon his bursting hemorrhage
        Removed the spear and leaning back attempting to gain leverage
        Kicked him in the chest with what little strength I could muster
        It had no affect I was trapped by death like the foolish Custer
        
        He smiled like a crocodile into my startled eyes he peered
        I see you found the precise point of the Old Clan’s spear
        With some cheer he took the blade the wound sealed sans a scratch
        And so I wondered who had laid the scar above his eye attached
        To my shaking soul I grew cold and hurried back
        Away from the carriage and the remains no longer intact 
        As I turned his mind had learned where I’d thought to Run
        Like Ole Durham I’d rather burn in hell then under this scorching sun
        
        I took that faithful Magnum one bullet in it spun
        And I hoped my best I’d lay down to rest in my savior’s arms
        my finger quivered on the trigger shot delivered to appoint just one
        Yet two arms held me tight without delight askew it grazed the sun
         I looked back the breath upon my back smelled like a day old corpse
        And noticed the shadow o’er me had wings like Hercules’s horse
        Ole Durham hogtied me up throwing me nameless with the luggage
        I mumbled through the rope tied round my teeth choking courage
        
        “So Macintyre we’re heading back to where this all began
        Back to your workshop and the homestead where this all will end
        I growled and I howled through the suffocating rope
        For I knew he had it in him to exploit humanity’s last hope
        Don’t get me wrong unlike the throngs I expected not to live
         the awkward speech was out of reach resilient eyes all I could give
        a gaze of hate I learned of late pestiferous infested
        A fawn a pawn the perfect dawn cleverly arrested
        
        
        
        
        
        At great length with inhuman strength Durham pulled the precious loot
        For the horses that once carried the coach now grew amongst the roots
        So once more my heart assured of nothing but disaster
        We marched until we reached a fence as white as alabaster
        It marked the beginning of the end of the only hearth and home
        Where my mother was born and died, the only one I’d ever known
        
        Then my sight wrapped tightly as my vision was extinguished
        But the voices of my son and wife I thankfully distinguished
        “In the Devil’s English” he said “call them closer still” 
        I screamed at them to run away, but they couldn’t hear my will
        My warning cries soon subsided as a striking blow
        Ripped my chest in an attempt to lay me down below
        And as I struggled to untie the muzzle pinned up in prison coach
        I heard Ole Durham say “Sorry Mam he didn’t make it home
        It’s my regret to inform you that poor Macintyre’s gone
        He lost his life in a noble fight before the fire-crack of dawn.” 
        
        “What…do you mean?” My wife at once stuttered shattered tears
        And I wished with all my might to fight my way right out of here
        “Let’s go to the house and I’ll tell you how outlaws ambushed our trail
        Just put a pot upon the stove I’ll list every tragic detail.”
        From far away I could not relay the misery of my thoughts
        As I heard the ominous ringing of two murderous shots
        
        Then a thump in turn bodies still warm Durham laid next to me
        The smell of lavender the touch of lace opposing ecstasy
        I’d never thought I’d have to live as the soft touch of a her hair
        Reminded me that my own greed had stripped my world bare
        Again we rode the dust it flowed suffocating my aching heart
        The coach rattled while I prattled feeling my lungs could tear apart
        Snaking through the desert I surrendered measurements of time
        I took a breath as to my left I thought of Auld Lang Syne
        
        I missed the smell of sawdust and the discoloring of rust
        I missed the love we made and her open arms of trust
        For it was I who did comply with Durham’s ingenious plan
         I came back shackled an animal tamed by the genius of man
        But man, flesh, and cherub are many different things
        Or one in the same traveling through horrific cosmic rings
        
        So as I was tossed around these thoughts conflicting in my head
        On my way somewhere unknown unto my final resting bed
        Durham was humming and singing that he had found two solid horses
        So as he whipped his song rang out with all the vigor of hell’s forces
         it conspired within me a demon’s choir dancing through the night
        Lost amidst chaotic reverie confined to emphatic tragic plight
        
        
        
        
        So with one last stare I focused a prayer to save my vagrant soul
         perhaps I might see the Great Light and rest with my family cold
        I reached in vain for the savior’s name albeit fate made me guilty
        It was my wicked will that caused it still convinced me innocently
        When your hands are tied and your eyes are blind what else can one do?
        But hope that fate will open the gate forgiving honest men of evil’s ruse
        Finally I felt no answer as my sweetheart rolled against me
         I was reminded how ole Durham chided The Kingdom was always empty
        
        
        Like Old Goodman Brown I rolled around amongst the anxious horror
        I started out a fine poor man while inside I grew much poorer
        Here we are as the loaded car came to a violent halt
        My stomach turned and twitched awaiting one final result
        He dragged me out without a bout threw me amongst the dusty ground
        “Macintyre I picked you out a lovely spot where the view is quite profound”
        He began to tie two laden objects to each of my calm hands
        Then roped my feet and assured me that I’d love the lay of the land
        
        And as a joke he laughed and smoked putting two coins in my hand
        “You’ll need to pay the fare and hell; I’d like to see you once again”
        He untied the fold around my eyes and I could no longer doubt
        The objects that were tied to me, which made me scream and shout
        Appalled as if I had not fallen downward far enough
        My good wife Lucille and my son Tim lay with me on the bluff
        I cried and gasped split visions past and cursed only myself
        For the devil himself knew he was there tied down upon that shelf
        
        Then Durham uttered those foretold words I shuttered at the thought
        He muttered something quietly as his cracked lips wrought
        “I’ll be circling over you when all is said and done
        The reaper knocks upon your door back home you’ll find no one
        In the kitchen the stove is hot with blood and toil
        And in the den the roaches swarm upon the wretched spoils.”
        
        I lay there baring a day and wished only to find my Magnum
        Or celebrate my circumstance with a friendly dose of Laudanum
        I dared not see my family there as vultures settled in
          Remnants evidence of the elements naturally fermenting
        When night came I feigned not to look at the dark beauty of the sky
        For the illumination of all constellations peered like Durham’s soulless eyes
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        When the morning flamed the barbed tongues came a picking bone
        And in the dawn without a yawn I prayed today they’d take me home
        I tried not to watch and sometimes rolled shooing the bastard flock away
         Whether it was in the air or on the ground the black winged creatures stayed
        Suddenly unexpectedly the ground sounded of strange vibration
        And soon a tune of hooves was heard I wished no jubilation
        I only desired to be with the fallen, knowing my last son
        Had most likely met the same fate and life’s love was surely gone
        
        But upon the horizon now enlivened I heard a familiar cry
        And the voice brought only tears to my scorched and mournful eyes
        “Pa?” he said and then he stopped and laid ambition down
        For he saw the sight of me next to what is buried in the ground
        “No Pa! No Ma!” I heard his quivering eyes start flowing 
         he gasped collapsed taken aback by what is not worth knowing
        
        “Will” I said as he could not began to manage the thought
        And he threw his hands about the mess waving the pestilence off 
        Coughing gagging I saw him heaving suddenly turning sick
        Then he composed himself and freed me from Durham’s nasty trick
        I had no strength to embrace my oldest son who clenched my coat
        Then took me in his arms and wrapped me where I soaked
        So the loss of life was saved as I began to ask
         he said he’d come from home then followed wheel tracks
        To this spot where I was to rot with the sad deceased
        And too this day I’m still unsure if I ever was released 
        
        For when I got home with time alone it came framing memory lapse
        And outside the night I swore I might have heard Ole Durham laugh
        But I didn’t follow my current sorrow like a treasure map
          then Will came in and said “I’ll break that poor Ole Bastard’s back”
        I told him he must wait for when the time was right
         That it might never come, a poet’s vision in the night
        So goes the joyful woes of man’s luring price foretold
        So goes the chilling tale of Three Great Heists of Old
