    <h1>
        The Metaphysical War
    </h1>

    <h2>
        By Thibodeau Trace
    </h2>

    <div> 
          

In the soft light of dawn a shoehorn swoops down and a perfectly black shoelace is tied
<br>
<br>
Scratching, defacing your, steaming self, sipping the factory cup
<br>
Waiting impatiently to start threading your day			You watch the purloined victims in the square: ragged, disheveled, a masquerade of misfits with their clothes frozen to their meager bodies-you burp ‘bruptly and Hi Ho to work you go---vrooooom-you’re off!
<br><br>
Your staggering rumpled sack faces the green nylon, which fills the canvas where everyone paints something different.  It has been weeks and your Gigantic Heart is shivering.
<br>
  <pre>                                      You see </pre>You see every mercurial tower that surrounds you and feel as though they are mountains you are destined to climb over…together you hope! 				 Blurry visions greet you like a misty morning-Today is the day to make a stand.  And you brightly think-“NITRO!”-“Live like there’s no tomorrow.”  
<br><br>
In route at 10 and 2 grinding the brakes to Hard News .  The factory cup slides along with further insulation like the new home windows.  
<br><br>
	Then you think of your coordinates at work, like Battleship you’re holed up in your very own F5 Dodecaquadrant-will the commander order hits today?  Then the woman at home occupies your mind and the leftover demands that didn’t make it out the other ear  last night come squabbling back:
<br><br>
    “pick up dry cleaning,
    <br><br>
mailbox
<br><br>
 milk,
 <br><br>  
stop by the lawyer’s office”-no time now as your view is flush with red brake lights...
<br><br>

You wake up early in the dark, late-at least too late to kiss your wife, but not too late for the factory cup. Slosh it down- rush to the closet -grab the uniform -grab the gun, assess the discipline once more in the mirror and then hurry outside to your car.  It sits in the driveway like a pristine philosophy,  the exhaust sputters  as you back out.  You glide through the streets like a shark looking for prey…
<br><br>
You head to the group of people shuffled around the makeshift kitchen.   From the swarthy steel bucket you ladle some oatmeal and turn to seek your comrades, the ones whom you’ve been fighting with for months now in the canvas where everyone paints something different. And there are pirates, pilfers, nomads, and ninjas, but mostly a herd of sleeping revolutionaries.  With a song on a sign you check on others in line and take deep breaths upon your vision-Paints mixing swirling about the canvas-Congealing... 
<br><br>
You’re sitting in the car stale smell of the factory cup on your breath, computer running tags, laughing to yourself trying to remember the punch line to the one your partner told you this morning.  The tags glisten, the paychecks keep squeezing through. Fishing with Stan this weekend? Is he free?
<br><br>
You put on a glob of fresh paint-join your comrades at the posts.  Stand looking out from your sagging hut, the Library and its’ Dripping wet Information pulls a smile from within-A Succulent
<br>
 Yawp! 
 <br>
Echoes of a long time coming, all of them have waited as you cry out with your brothers-Let there be Light! 
<br> 
And then motion above dispersing towards the sleepy city. 		 On the street a hodge-podge man asks: “Have you heard the news? They dream blues by the twos on Pennsylvania Avenue Snooze.  Is it true is it true?” He shouts like a Christmas Day Boy?	 So we threw him a song and set him a sail.	  He came along with crashing colorful disaster… 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Arrive at the magnetic gate.
<br>
 Distill a greeting to Lisa.
 <br>
 Scan the target lock. .
 <br>
Run to the conjoined twins and pour the factory cup.  
<br>
You reach out and press shuffle on the stack of papers in front of you.  
<br>
Look at the enclosing, at her picture-then think: “the lawyer’s office?”  
<br>
You look out into a curtain of clouds- a concentration of color approaches off in the vagrant mist…  
<br><br>
You come romping and reeling, stomping and keeling, back and forth with a knapsack full of smoking seeds, your brothers exhaling a mist like Gibran’s. SING SING MIKE CHECK SING!
<br>
And you are throwing them around the city like questions. 
<br> 
And for some odd reason the world perks up its forlorn ears and waits. 
<br>
 You can see the quadrant elect shaking their heads in dismay.  The cannons ring from the songs we sing and their blood begins to flow…
<br><br>
Identification around your neck you look out at them like helplessness like hopelessness like homelessness.  You breathe a sigh of relief. It’s still squeezing in for you.  You turn to the rag beside you-“It says they’re at it again, this time they’re being asked to relocate, to remove the canvas.” 
<br> 
“Thank God!” you think, flagrantly sending up a prayer.  You do a few things at the shuffleboard then hit the factory cup…   
<br><br>

You are sitting there talking to a coworker at a little intersection you call the Ticket Pit and the call comes in.  Your needed at The Mall-Imagination is running rampant- on the loose…it must be subdued, a surrender must be administered.  They are a pestiferous group spreading the thoughts of spoiled minds. Don’t they understand this isn’t How IT Works!
<br><br>
You look out again as the mass of color approaches you see another fleet of color screeching to face them on the horizon.  Red and Blue verses a Rainbow of People: workers, anarchists, teachers, doctors, soldiers, all students-learning together.			The Hodge-podge man cries out 
<br>
“Who’s Dream is this?”     
<br>
And together you roar as the shark doors open and out pour the anti-enemies.
<br><br>
You see the depreciating brigand of revelers lined up like a phalanx marching parallel to that row of sparse trees.  Then you are ordered to hold the line.  You can see them stomping towards you only 100 yards off.  Hundreds of them with mud covered faces dreaded in scrawny delight overwhelmed by their passion for paint.  You lock arms with your comrades in blue and keep a hand close to the ZAP.
<br><br>
“Let there be Light!” 
<br>
ZAP BACK
<br>
ATTACK
<br>
ZAP ZAP ZAP as if hanging from 
<br>
the porch Lamp
<br>
SING SING MIKE CHECK SING
<br>
ZAP BACK ATTACK
<br>
ZAP!
<br><br>
<i>And there are cries and screams but mostly in our Dreams.</i>  
<br><br>
You look out from your quadrant and you see the standoff. For once you witness the Metaphysical War, though you are unaware. Inflicted infected… But soon you are thinking of home and again “The lawyer’s office, what for?” 
<br><br>
You hold strong, sweeping your line to theirs-trimming the Fat.  They are a force, but you are forceful and no one moves. 100% No One Moves.
<br> 
“Hold the line!” A lieutenant yells.   
<br>
ZAP ZAP ZAP
<br>
SNAP!
<br>
The line breaks like someone throwing paint the congregation scatters past the blue barber suits.  They are running towards the quadrant elect waving their arms and signs and sapping souls.  The Red and Blue team hurries after them…
<br><br>
You think “this isn’t How IT Works-fucking nut jobs.”  And you strap as many of them in plastic cuffs as you can, so as to detain others. 
<br>
A lesson must be learned.
<br>
A precedent must be set.
<br>
ZAP BACK ATTACK! 
<br><br>
<pre>You think of your colorful comrades...</pre>
You sit on the curb with your eyes on fire as if they were burning from the inside out. You cannot scratch  them for your song is momentarily strewn across the ground. Relief is just next door.  
<br>
Several of your comrades are plasti-wrapped and smiling in the snowy sun.  You are marched back to alabaster tanks and taken to be processed and implanted
<br><br>
You grab the young vagrant; he looks angry, frightened, confused.  You throw him in the back behind the gate.  Speed towards the station.  A precedent must be set. “He should be in school not out here!” You think.
<br>    
“You know son this isn’t How IT Works?”
<br>    
“What?” the starving youth expels. Half his face red the other purple, with a bleeding peace symbol on his forehead.
<br>    
“Changing things, you don’t just abandon everything and march through the city demanding things.”
<br>
“Who said that’s what I was doing?
<br>
“That’s what it looked like to me. Where the hell is your mom?”
<br>
“In your buddy’s car I think-you guys got her, don’t worry”
<br>
“What—Jesus-I get it now!”  And you rolls your eyes because they keep squeezing through for you
<br>
 Hungry now Food. 
<br>
 something on the way home?
 <br>
 Call Stan.
<br>
<br>
<br>
You think about your colorful comrades and hope that they will be with you in your cell.  You arrive and some of them are along with one suited man in spectacles.  You sing and chant the story and wait for a lucky number.   
<br>
When it’s called you stagger back to the canvas surrounded by a rainbow of sleeping elephants.  
<br>
You lay down your head on some damp crumpled t-shirts, tired, worn out by the warmth in your heart. These smoldering incantations slip off soundly to sleep
<br><br>
With trembling legs
<br>
You rush out of the Dodecaquadrants
<br> 
hurry a forgetful goodbye to Lisa.  
<br>
The lawyer’s office now,
<br> 
not abandoning ten and two 
<br>
you are the Ali of Traffic
<br>
The Sugar Ray of Lanes
<br>
Until…
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You see him from atop the hill weaving swiftly through the rows of traffic like a silver fish.  A bright grey Honda Sprat threading the needle with each car it passes. 
<br> 
He runs a red light.
<br> 
Flying through the Ticket Pit<br> 
without a seatbelt.<br>
 It angers you to the point of disbelief<br>
Boiling blankly inside<br>
You Turn’em on and set out to chomp down more Sprat.<br>  
<br>
You fly through a red light only missing by a second.  No Hard News; 10 and 2  just you and the lawyer’s office.  Then you hear the sound behind you.  A wailing      a	 whining,	
 A flickering of  two colors.
 “Fuck, Damn, Shit!”  And you proceed to pull off to the side of the road your tires grumbling to a halt.

You light him up while running his shiny display.  
Son of a bitch
He stops.
You approach the vehicle cautiously as you’ve been trained.
You see a white man in his mid-thirties.
Relaxed, you follow procedure.
License, registration, where we’re you going?


Primped and polished he comes from behind.  You roll the window down barely.  He asks you to roll it down further, but you refuse.  You hand him your certificate of merit and privilege, but after a small argument about the light being yellow or red when you passed it- he storms off.  Not before telling you to Stay In Your Car.

Your buddy pulls up
You inform him
Then you start spinning scrolls:
			
Failure to wear restraint device: $25
 Failure to stop at a steady red signal: $150 
 Reckless operating of a motor vehicle on open roadway: $250

You hand the driver his tickets. 
 He throws them on the street and curses at you.
You threaten him instinctively.
He does not respond

You spin another

				 Littering on a motorway: $50

You then ask him to exit the vehicle
He refuses


He asks you to exit the vehicle    You object.  
He repeats himself asking once more.  But you tell him you will take your tickets and go.  he says you” aren’t going anywhere.”
  Suddenly, 		the glass is smashed. 		Terrified 
you jump back, but he has already grabbed you and pulled you onto the icy concrete.  You yell and curse as your teeth hit the cement. Your glasses break in the fallen blood and you are transported by the rapture of Fine Steel.


You grab the suited suspect, rough him like a code orange day then throw him back behind the gate
“What’s your problem buddy?”
No response, he’s checking every tooth with his tongue
“I was gonna let you drive home but you had to get smart”
 time to suffer… like you can’t remember a time you weren’t in pain.

 Fees, fear, stress linger. You are taken to a cell littered with other refuges of freedom.  You notice the people who surround you are the same misfits from the square, a few colors from the rainbow of people you saw marching today.  They ask you why you’re here and you tell them that you have no idea. You inquire of them and they mirror your response everyone staring at the thick steel door and the small window, their eyes clamoring for a bolt.  You still think about the lawyer’s office and as the silence closes in you begin to hear them singing and celebrating and you consider them fools…And yourself a fool and thus you began to talk about this foolish world.

You get home three hours before you are to appear at F5 and she’s sound asleep.  You roll into bed and click the Sony Rooster.  You can’t sleep- the people- the march- the lawyer’s office. You blink and the radio shrieks…The factory cup and you’re up long before the day bell.  You look down at the murky square.  You wonder where that purple/green faced fellow from the cell is in that mass of messy bodies below. Coexisting in such a small square, a tiny cube of space on a child’s wondrous ball-how do they do it?   Foolish world

You wake up early in the dark, late-at least too late to kiss your wife, but not too late for the factory cup. Slosh it down- rush to the closet -grab the uniform -grab the gun, assess the discipline once more in the mirror and then hurry outside to your car.  It sits in the driveway like a pristine philosophy, the exhaust sputters as you back out.  You glide through the streets like a shark looking for more prey to squeeze in…

Free, hope, calm lingers. You shiver and shift your weight into a puddle.  
Trying to resist you’re wakened by the moisture. 		
Your ribs shaking in hunger you walk past the swarthy bucket 		Out
 into the canvas where everyone paints something different.  You seek your comrades and chatter how hearts splatter across the pealing sidewalk. With pitter patters like jack hammers you strafe the grounds calling out. Eyes glisten like immortal sun:
Today		Today
Is the Day	Is The Day
That is 		That is 
Tomorrow	Tomorrow	and  Now		and Now
					       Is the Time		is the Time
					To move mountains	To move mountains 
					Like True Humans		Like True Humans
					To Climb out			To Climb out 
					Without doubt        		Without doubt
					
Let Old Skin Shed and as they roared the painting began to appear as something unlike before.  Something curiously efficient.  Something like a silent love and as ancient as petrified roots. 
They grew out of the canvas and turned the gears of society in a gilded way. Wooden leather Roots clasped over our gears steering them back again.  They forge a Council ahead of their time. They are New Abolitionists, freeing our dinning cars and reservoirs. Lanes of travel and expatriation.  

When the ships came from the East the Natives only saw the rippling water, but could not perceive the ships themselves.

    The temperament of our sails is of great Faith in the unity of Human Becomings. You wait for your comrades from the south, north, east, and west, reinforcements blown in by a colorful wind as you SING, MIKE CHECK, SING! 


Flowers nettle in our tangerine minds




You stop by the lawyer’s office and get the documents. Your signature is needed to make it official.  You head to your quadrant
Arrive at the magnetic gate.
 Distill a greeting to Lisa.
 Scan the target lock. 
Run to the conjoined twins and pour more factory cup.  
You reach out and press pause on the stack of folders in front of you.  You steer towards your window. Lucid with holes 
 You see the canyon approaching.  The two sides now visible 	And	 invisible	 like a reef or hive with manic droves contained. 
a canyon amidst two forces.  You see them all… thousands this time. Marching in the Metaphysical War  They fill entire city blocks
 verbal liquid thesis sifting street telekinesis. 

When you think it cannot rain any harder, deafening one’s skull, that’s when it begins to pour 

You turn to her picture/the mob/picture/mob/back and back again then about face out there  in-purple/green you recognize-a friend from the cell and slam your forehead with a pain drilling crown bite hypnosis. Then wham the rug and your eye level with untouchable surge protectors (electricity buzzing). 


Finally you decide to rise

 Rip the picture of her from the wall
  press Stop on the stack of papers. 
Toss 		your 			Factory 				Cup
Throw		your 		ID				Out 

Xroom! You’re off with adrenaline spiraling freely down the rabbit hole expanding as you look to join the Legion of Rebirth…



Leatherback Turtle Phalanx		 Black armored cocktail suits gather broadside for the skirmish as you and your friends collect with visiting Tribes
. Blast Signs and Songs and Souls hang like bloodless banners raging battle cries. Dreams of the New Abolitionists. Rimbaud’s Illuminist
 
 the Hodge-Podge Man stands with shifty masks in his hand: “We whittle your worries away, two pence per persona, per day.”   		

His voice rings true and	You are marching with more comrades than ever before.  vigilance an unbroken Testimony.  Overwhelmed with invincible conviction, others join the preposterous ranks.
 Waitress, street sweepers, waste management workers, and steel drivers: The precious unions fill a windless city.  They see the wind-ups straightening their backs.  Taking pride in their own lives- full100%. 

Pebbles fill the stream and break apart the water

  Every suit of card stands lined like Lexington.

							Apaches, Shawnee, Sioux, Makah shedding skin 

through the pastel jungle like epoxy in the sea.   

The two sides meet at the sun and the sea

							Old hourglass mirror 	goblet faces

AT that point they encounter Contact 			Vibrating beads of expanding integers

Engineering light and first contact				

Where the sun and the sea touch


You raise your baton and hold firm your plastic shield.  You can feel the wind of the people rushing at you blowing through the shield like cellophane Hurricanes -You send a whooshing can of smoke, but it becomes a Douglas Adams’ Deadline. The war intoxicates your senses

 The Crowd is close like icy mist upon your breath, 
 The Crowd is close like bedding ticks upon your skin. 
 The Crowd is close inside your stream of spotless red and white.
 The Crowd is close upon your wheeling mind. 
 The Crowd is close in our Time.  The Crowd is close to freedom

Rushing crack when the bloodline rolls off the walls the defense is limitless and the force is infinite.  
The Crowd builds like a bursting clog.  And the clubs and spades, and moldy hearts washed away in a sea of smoking blue fire… 

Your shield is gone and you are in a Crowd of feet and homicidal dust.  The dust is being kicked into your lungs choking on a safety cone and your gun is lost in the onslaught of color and one grabs you his face a neon red decapitating your immobility and he reaches and grabs you up from the muck 
He brushes you off in the sea of smoking blue fire

And then where the sun and the sea touch
 you stand like a Sprawling Oak that recognizes its plantation within the Earth and there they pour past you… The Crowd  keeps marching…into the infinite foothills. ..You follow them ..

next to you a green and purple face with a peace symbol. Wielding eyes of a New Capitol architect.  
And him in his ripped suit and dirt covered tie a future bio-technical plasma engineer
And you in your black gear with three useless letters…You a future peace keeper of organic inspiration

Up into the Center of peaks holding a New Illuminist Agora. You follow them marching with songs and signs and paint New Capitol designs, a black bird flying over blue flame 

A Black Bird  		

FLy   	FLying   	   Flew Over Blue Flame

Overhead your creamy hazelnut latte blurred by the reflection of the Black Bird, you stop… it glares from a tree wire into the cup

Black, its pupil’s shine- where the sun touches the sea

Its eyes reflect in the flawless white cup, looking at you on the slate patio, examining you with caution and mistrust.  The wind blows surface steam away… your legs crossed.  Head tossed over the id around your neck …watching people go by a fainting day departs.  


 The Bird catches a drift and sails, eclipsing the mortuary sky. The sky’s bleakness made of a white terror that screams into the heights…a blank canvas waiting for painted heavens, a sprinkle on the rag beside you/ “I’m the neon rain baby-cakes!  I’m a gonna set you free!”    You look up
 Dry powdered clouds swirl the latte with your rolled Pirouette Wafer breathing softly…they keep marching…
