    <h1>
        Children of Imagination
    </h1>

    <p>In the eyes of youth all is summertime</p>
Green grain pastures portend sweet harvest dark
Wavering, blinking, splashing in the froth
Casting suicide grins at mountain tops
Speak to the willows rotting by the stream
“Suck me, fuck me, suck me” Life is calling!
Scabs pick spots for shady memory dreams
Train car art is rampant in scant blue stalls
Blood bitter on the flags of burning tongues
Appalled in shock and bra pantyhose noose
Let loose let loose it is your own kingdom
Win some just to know loss and toss at night
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Whose cackling bonfire journey never ends
The jest of her breath will carry thee to
A place where stained curtains never can fall
And pestilence is as lull as the law
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Awaken from the forsaken, take in
The razor waves of Harmony’s last graves
The stalks cut out from Philosophy’s maze
When the Combine Roars and the Future Calls
Listen to the fire that once spoke for all
Gaze at your scars, dark stars, cracking white night
They’ll be there beside you holding you tight
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
In the distance a listless clamor stands
With a firm eye and a slight shaking hand
It is but you, lost in the harvest fields
Black and White Rainbow, with nothing to yield
The Red Wheelbarrow, firewood laden
Replaced by the Combine slaying, jaded
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Walk through the treetops bellies full of wine
With a canvas net capturing the sublime
Pupils refined in a sweet purpling mist
Cantaloupe Mango juice drips from your wrist
Carpe Nocturne Mi Gitano Mariposa
 Hombre! sus suenos son su esposa
You walk through sandstorms blowing a mirage
Hourglass striking silhouette your image
Running like willow trees pulled in the sun
Clear water stone rolls through tows you beyond
Cerebellum bread dripping soft like leaves
we kissed underwater ‘till we could breathe
Lo Brave Children of Imagination
Echoing chasms dank metro stations
It was those puddles of mud your old love
Kept splashing splashing renew sensation
wet chalk makes the mindscape melt like fresh felt
pelts of your past I’m wearing in my sleep 
So when I arise like riot and root
Kettledrum buckets and Tambourine flutes 
Are aloof beady bean eyes greedy green sighs
Encourage entourage of wrath not scat
Cold shoulder courage we’re taking it back
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Whose slate is steepened with volcanic foot
Those scourging fire eyes peek through ash and soot
And stealth until wealth relay orphan caves
Undreamed trades incognito enclave
graze from the mother’s hand she gave you screams
 steam beats howling through  pin canyons without
doubt what true  emphatic  journeys about 
And run down hills full of pills in the sun
Mojo-synthesis cradling you’ve become
A new creature crawling in neon toothpaste
Repositioned your mission interlaced
Filament pigments caressing the skin
Li symmetry roadmap where to begin?
Again in the gardens Milton has said
All is not lost unconquerable will
In the hands of your breath precious and still
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Chase sacred pearls in the mind’s deep ocean
Skin cream Sunbeams implore buoyant motion
Alas hoping, gazing, freezing the frost 
Until wildest piercing thoughts have gone lost
And what remains ashamed in the new zoo
Is but a glance of the past heart of you
Heed your heels while they feel a clover’s touch
For when the world is sold it’s not worth much
Or nothing, like drinks, and going to lunch
Behold the blasphemy shiny consorts 
Great voices knotted it twists to contort
Like Memphis blues cried on a balcony
Imagination is the ultimate 
Alchemy, is lost in the endless vaults
Prey my child on what shall never be taught
If you remain broke till the day you die
With laughing gas pouring from both your eyes
Remember it was she who pulled at Keats 
Told Jack to keep bumming, bebop top streets
Beats, Grass Leaves, Percy-Pessoa-Kahlil
Took in her essence, but never got filled
Laughing, splashing, off flowery deep end
Oh Brave Children of Imagination 
Come conquer in brilliance with all who stand
Ride leaves the wind begins to fall again
To journey’s end we’ll meet far beyond there
A sunburnt smile beneath long singing hair
 In crystal wine-light a cape full of night
 celestial fireflies shine ire tears  
 stark beauty revealed  to us in ripe years
While they pine, whine, pry, dine, pay for a touch
 Gas that laughs for that which cannot be grasped
Even ink dries quickly at the last task
Lo Brave Children of Imagination
Burning through wintery spells and quiet hell
 know this visage image not where we dwell
our hearts pulse like sand at the ocean’s edge
in waves of silence streaming through tossed heads
And conduct deconstruct humble abode
Purple shade lily pads beckoning toad
stools pools cool water lay dreaming, she said
chase me ‘round fire in teal skies overhead 
through fields of darkness sedimentary smoke
my words in Leaves of Grass and Sand and Foam
Go home my child let the heart skip no beat
Search potent wilderness and gutter streets
Let not the frost fall stiff upon your back
Or quicksilver run your veins in attempt
To slip early from pearly illusions
Confusions delight not by obtrusion
 Missionary of faint mystery’s will
Wait in the craters as falling stars fill 
Your eyes with surprise of a sleepless life
 much you can learn by not talking at night
Crestfallen, hungry, the harvest will stop
when seeds take flight towards mountainous plot
a lot to ask from impetuous minds
 leaves are turning my child, now is the time
Oh brave children of Imagination
Hold to the willow breeze salutation
 forget not zeal-twisted summer embrace 
walk with curiosity tree tea lace
glow in corners with idea farmers
 from unspoken eye blue smoke snake charmers
evoke a spark where soul fire sleeps within 
 let the new zoo creatures feature their grins
 cast yours to space grace bend the horizon
amazing child, still will, you shall find them
eternally naked down glacier cloth
full force in sweet fire before grey chain frost 
heartbeat’s still in moth afraid of Great Flames
Ignatius like passion crack the Great Frames
Tis already pictured snapshot bright eyes
Shall hold off the winter until we die
 Stone rose gone no clothes face resignation
We the Children of Imagination
Curiosity tips skies we walk on
Uncovered trips lift bright curtains of dawn
Sauntering on beyond song luring flash
Immortal madness cosmic ever last
Blossoming granite tooth corpse of the earth
Courageous outrageous contagious birth
Circus smiles at you from fright shiny top
Misery glycerin smothers the crop
And the treasures of mind taste you right there
Emboldened behold golden old showman 
Stare down artillery spun shadows race
Encased in a murmur spur wintry chase
Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Eyebrows like banners rise up New Blue Sun
Piercing the horizon lucid loves forms
Torrent the storm fondling icy black wings
Calming the pleasure tonic measure of dreams
Beaming forth cannons pour cold gaping death
The struggle blood muscles save another’s breath
Holographic insignia adorned
Monk in the fire your spirit returns
Learning still yearn sultry black ivory
wrapped ‘round your heart, a snake made of ivy
Cosmos, Birds Eye’s, Calendula Daisies
Zinnia, Blue Sage, Crimson Clover, Shasta Daisies
Golden Lupine, Blue flax, Morning Glory 
Primrose eyes, jaws opened like a story
Tender her fangs hang like two waning moons
 Green warmth she basks in summer time’s costume
‘round heart she looks for shadows overhead
with icicle talons spiraling heads 
Lest you forget Ignatius gracious one
of few who visit  from worlds beyond 
laughing wild flowers as they nigh harvest
rusting ole Combine nay shall they harm us
 Oh Brave Children of Imagination
Listen to the Willows gnarled faces
Crawling into canyons quasar spaces
Exalted rapture pricked by human thought
Never alone, spears, fear, fire! We brought
When seasons grey hair from your wicked Mind
the New Blue Sun enlightens path’s divine
remember pure tune nature’s elation 
You a Brave Child of Imagination!
Galloping asunder under white cloth
Spark the rag, split the crest, bottles will toss
In the trough of ill-design, due time
You’ll see, sunken Prison-Ship Mastery
Believe me they have mortal men to sell
Seasons turn red, like beauty, grace, and hell
Feet crunch aloud turning deadly abyss
Falling fire wildflowers burn scarring kiss
Arrangements cloistered despot summertime
Without end born like the “Triumph of Life”
Sweet love, sweet knife, final sweet taste of strife
 Rip the nails and quietly learn to fly…
