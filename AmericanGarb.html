        <h1>American Garb</h1>
        <h2>By Thibodeau Trace</h2>

        <p>Shank of juicing portly American Garb.  Take it off! Take it off!  Thrust access grease and confused fryer trap faces.  My body is covered in the costume of a dying race</p>
            
        <p>When I leave and return it’s as if David became Taft.</p>
            
        <p>One must search for a place in the bountiful groves for love’s measure</p>   
            
        <p>Here-with too many places to sit. No wooden capillaries to climb</p>
        
        <p>Time cradled us in a ticking swing, do we refuse to stop it to reach out and walk about -7,000 mile stretches I take atop benches</p>
            
        <p>When age comes prying with blind fortune and commodity, will it roll us under?-or will we stand like Muir in our old age?-darkened from the Forest</p>
            
        <p>Hair of white pine trees withering in autumn’s mist</p>
            
        <p>A gaze that takes a lifetime to receive</p>
            <br>
            Shave the waves of disgrace from your chest, graft the skin from neck and mind<br>
             feel your legs pulling tighter.<br>
            -let the access evaporate<br>
            Build another’s home with it. Fill another’s heart with it <br> 
            
            <p>But not in a place</p>
            
            <p>Where they think empty space:  a pair of trousers</p>
            
            <p>Where space is more reason for foggy junkyards and material graveyards pushing steam</p>
            
            <p>And when we omit to debasing this our gifted body admits defeat and we’re no longer in our minds except a mind of excess</p> 
            
            <p>We accept a seldom cell-you cannot tell me you don’t worry over objects</p>
            
            <p>This mind of excess a constant plunge</p>
            
            <p>Look to the falcon who guides capturing whirlwind</p>
            
            <p>wings sleek, supremely fine	</p>
            
            <p> Abundant- the current of nature </p>  
            
            <p>starving- the mind of excess</p>
            
            <p>we accept a seldom cell			do not fear your own inspiration</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            </p>
