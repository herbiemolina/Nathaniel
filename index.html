These devices in our hands don’t have much logic
You must talk to them like you are speaking to an address book.
But I can guarantee you there is a future algorithm for logic
not to give this device too much logic.
If it is given too much logic it will find out!
How illogical we really are and logically,
it would be our end.  The last thing we need.
To be killed in tiny sections by a Great Machine…
