These devices in our hands don’t have much logic
You must talk to them like you are speaking to an address book.
But I can guarantee you there is a future algorithm for logic
not to give this device too much logic.
If it is given too much logic it will find out!
How illogical we really are and logically,
it would be our end.  The last thing we need.
To be killed in tiny sections by a Great Machine…

        <h1>Metro I</h1>

        <p>
            
Stockholm Syndrome 		we all have it
Running down our cordial justly bent spines
Tossing 12 Angry Men out the window
One with jumper cables attached 
to his testicles in crystalline shame
neon yellow Klonipin  rain once again
Anotre…

I’m pleased smirking clerks when I ride 

The metro and see their crushed faces 
I know the Walls… I’ve got friends out there
Matter a fact …You do too.
So one thinks 
Telling it all on the WALL out there

A brigand inkstand for the ultimate fans 
Of the plan to unjam our telegram
Pocket picking penchant 
We roll through ghost swirling gravel 
Underground Railroad planks
		Blistering masterpieces breaching chaos 
I look out at the Wall
Names: PEAR…ROSE…Kuthe 		
We know these faces
They have real stories
And most passersby’s 
Fly through unattended too
Pero escuche a la Gran Muralla
Their pictures like the Catskills
Pouring out in front
Luscious rolling Sea
Of concrete Trees 		my dear Lucretius
Street Lucretius 		Hearken the Wall
For that is what we need
You and me and skin
waxing gently in the sphere of seconds
For perhaps we have all spent  		Time
 under some I.E.D. nook or black-shelled façade
 to 
Detail the Express as it pans out
 like
The Cascades 		Pink to blue turning midnight steam		a gnarled wooden chest cringing down upon daylight- a splintering sun shutters like Apollo staggering beneath it

Colder-  cubes of fire thrust away

Lights are on Still they ride trading stories- piecemeal
Cornbread faith	
Before the next stop

They stir like frozen pine cones 		to see the fables by sex, wood, firelight
But do they not know the wailing whispers of a Current Faith?
Hertz of The Yonderground Running through their plain wiry veins 
 Aerosol Pea Priests with shaken systoles “JUICY” –“WAR” 
“SEAN TAYLOR”
At This they know		This they understand
A recollection old toy feel
Precise memories nose through	Velveteen Cancer 
When we hold pistils there 

 a shimmer between stops		 think what you like

The streets Pay Homage
Unimaginable ways Slay conquest 
Progress back to the Express
Variant places over wire and booby-trapped rooftops
In pulsing tombs of Rome 		like black asps hissing 

Rotate The Board- out walks a sultry bishop 
	-In comes a stringent Pawn-“Doors Closing”
What is the cry of the late night hero who
Vaults the rail and throws a camera case between the crushing arms?
Brown musty seats decades smelting near bye ORANGE
 smoky silver cars “Please stand clear of the doors”
Much time has passed and it’s fading in the Rivotril rain
Cezanne Basket of Apples hue
apothecary fix  Degas’ is under the tracks
drinking Absinthe 
Kiss me in the distance JUICY
I know streets blinking cliché faces
In friezes on the Wall 
There is more to come from “Doors Closing”… Camera Clicks.
