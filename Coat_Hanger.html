        <h1>Coat Hanger</h1>
            <h2>By Thibodeau Trace</h2>

You put your coat on the coat hanger in the closet
<br><br>You put your coat on the coat hanger in the closet
<br><br>You put your shoes in the recycling bin
<br><br>Who needs them old things anyway?
<br><br>Been around the block doubting every sidewalk squandering sunshine, bleed and breath darkness now
<br><br>You put your glasses in the dishwasher there clean broken now, no water spots though just shards and cards on the bathroom sink
<br><br>Playing Go Fish with yourself in front of the mirror 
<br><br>“Do you have any fives?”
<br><br>“mmm…yup.”
<br><br>“Do you have any queens?”
<br><br>“mmm…yup”
<br><br>Do you have any eights?”
<br><br>“mmm...yup, how does this fucker know my hand”
<br><br>“Do you have any two’s? 
<br><br>To do yes I have things to do!
<br><br>So Go fish you cheatin son of a bitch! 
<br><br>With a six-pack at dusk I think I just might put my literature in the laundry it needs to be refreshed.  She’s reading me the same old bedtime story again, Corduroy the Bear, I can hardly bare my ass in public they said it was public intoxication, but I blew nothing for the poor or the needy sweetie I am the poor soul stumbling through the dank alley ways of life.
<br><br>The knife goes in the recycling bin in case anyone tries to wear my shoes, off my porch you frontally lobed challenged pestering mongrel a mix she said “more than one kind.”
<br><br>“I’ll take em do you have a bag or a cage or should I just scoop them up like precious flowers in my arms, needle in my neck this can’t be as beautiful as when I carved it wrote road down towards the Miller’s Corner Store you’ll see the Silo it’s as green as the good end
<br><br>of a turnip turn up the noise I’m too concentrated 100% Zimbabwean she unraveled after the kids were gone
<br><br>I thought you were from the islands I landed after all these years finally came down out of the mounds of clouds, cloudy, the future is presented with a polka dotted golden bow filled with answers to all the dust out there must be the 1930s again so perty if you could just part the spiral arms of the galaxy like old curtains then I might know what I’m doing here.  it’s gone, I don’t know where the kids are I never see them now that she’s gone I put my glove down just after I came in from the game can’t find it now, 
<br><br>Mom said she had a surprise something we could do just her and me for fun now that dads gone don’t they wonder how their father’s doing?  They never call what day is it?  The little green plastic box says it’s Monday, but I know I took those already its’ got to be Thursday I just forgot to ta, where is the remote?  
<br><br>Right here dad! But before I give it to you promise me you won’t ever go away again, promise! 
<br><br>I told her I would meet her there that’s why I bought this ring, she’s the one , definitely, there’s no other woman like her, I’ve got the Pontiac shined up and my derby hat on tight- told her too and made reservations. I promised I wouldn’t be late too late can you really miss your chance at the one…C’mon dad…just one…just one more before I go to bed…Then I’m done…how could I have more I’ll be sleeping, please dad, paahleeease!
<br><br> Please I’d wish one of them would come home, but it doesn’t look much like home anymore there’s no basement or upstairs just this shiny blinding white bathroom with giant bars around the john and that string coming out of the wall what the hell is that?  
<br><br>Where did it come from? I never put it there if I pull, “On his pant leg sweetheart, you’ll get his attention, I know he’s at his work desk, but he has time for you just go and pull at it.”
<br><br>Rrrrriiinngg rrrrrrinnng, “That’s all for today class, don’t forget your project for Monday, William Bradford can I see you for a moment…
<br><br>Sure Mrs.  Stetson, screeching at me I’m, I’ve I just, why? what is screaming at me? Screeching still I’ve got to get out of this white light and the bars what is this?  And I don’t know why they ever come, they never come.  
<br><br>“Mr.  Bradford?”…
<br><br>Uuhh, what? 
<br><br>Oh Celia!  My girl, its’ been so long oh Celia!  you didn’t give up on your old dad.  Darling you were always my favorite.
<br><br>Celia, sweetness can you help me? I need to get something from the workshop downstairs.  I carved something for you.  Where are the stairs again dear?  Are you hot, It’s awfully hot, Jesus I’m sweating, I’m, I’m boiling up…
<br><br>“Mr.  Bradford”
<br><br>…uuhh whyat?”
<br><br>“Remember Mr. Bradford you put your coat on the coat hanger in the closet.  Here let me get it for you.”
